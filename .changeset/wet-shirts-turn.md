'@lit/localize-tools': patch
---

- Existing XLIFF files will be updated instead of re-generated, so additional data added by other processes (such as `state="translated"` attributes) will be preserved instead of deleted.
- XLIFF `<note>` elements generated by Lit Localize will now have a `from="lit-localize"` attribute to distinguish them from other notes.
