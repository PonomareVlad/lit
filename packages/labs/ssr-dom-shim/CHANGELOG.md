# @lit-labs/ssr-dom-shim

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#3522](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/3522) [`72fcf0d7`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/72fcf0d70b4f4644e080e9c375a58cf8fc35e9e8) - When running in Node, Lit now automatically includes minimal DOM shims which are
  sufficient for most SSR (Server Side Rendering) use-cases, removing the need to
  import the global DOM shim from `@lit-labs/ssr`.

  The new `@lit-labs/ssr-dom-shim` package has been introduced, which exports an `HTMLElement`, `CustomElementRegistry`, and default `customElements` singleton.

  The existing `@lit-labs/ssr` global DOM shim can still be used, and is compatible with the new package, because `@lit-labs/ssr` imports from `@lit-labs/ssr-dom-shim`. Importing the global DOM shim adds more APIs to the global object, such as a global `HTMLElement`, `TreeWalker`, `fetch`, and other APIs. It is recommended that users try to remove usage of the `@lit-labs/ssr` DOM shim, and instead rely on the more minimal, automatic shimming that `@lit/reactive-element` now provides automatically.
